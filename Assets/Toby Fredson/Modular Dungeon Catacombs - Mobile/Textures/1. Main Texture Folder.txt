1. Main texture workflow

Standard metalness shader workflow. Merged maps for the metalness/AO/Gloss.

*Tip

To regain the channels in the "metalness/ao/gloss" (MAG) png textures, simply re-save them using an image editor, (I personally use "XnViewMP") and save it as a TIF/TGA or split and merge the channels in Substance Designer.
